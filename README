Rhea                    version 0.0.0

When ye least expect it, there Rhea will be,
and your screams will break your throats.

Configuration management for Minetest using git version control in Perl.

Rhea is a script (and supporting library) written in Perl that wraps calls 
to the git version control system to help manage Minetest server 
configurations, especially one's collection of 'mods' (plugins, addons). 
Integrity of each individual mod is maintained with git submodules; Rhea 
takes care of the "hair" associated with this feature. Server operators 
can experiment with mod combinations, edit individual mods, and push the 
entire set or an individual to GitHub for others to try. 

Rhea also manages multiple minetest.conf files, merging them into 
a single file for play.
